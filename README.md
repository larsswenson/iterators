# Java Collection Manipulation Program

This Java program demonstrates collection manipulation techniques using `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `TreeMap`. It includes examples of iterating, modifying, and analyzing data structures.

## Description

The program is divided into three main parts:

### `ArrayList`
- Initializes an `ArrayList` of 10 random integers.
- Iterates over the list, printing integers, and calculating the sum.
- Modifies the list during iteration by removing integers over 50.

### `HashMap`
- Initializes a `HashMap` with string keys and integer values.
- Iterates over `HashMap`, prints each key-value, and modifies the map, incrementing "Books" and removing "Food".

### `TreeMap`
- Initializes a `TreeMap` with string keys set to months and double values set to average temperatures.
- Iterates over `TreeMap` printing the highest and lowest temperatures with the corresponding months.

Compile and Run the Program

Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code and execute the following commands:

```bash
javac CollectionManipulation.java
